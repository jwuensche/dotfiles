# Dotfiles

This repository contains my used dotfiles for [sway](), [waybar](), [wofi](), [mako](), [wob](), and [redshift]().

## sway

My sway config is orientated to behave similar to the ol' bspwm.

> Take note that you have to change somethings like the device ids for input methods, and monitor names/resolution/offsets.
> They can be easily retrieved with `swaymsg -t get_inputs` and `swaymsg -t get_outputs`.

## waybar

🥳 It's emojified 🚀

Properties displayed are workspaces, sway modes, date and time, displaylock inhibitor, current audio volume, network devices, cpu usage, ram 🐏 usage,
temperature, display brightness and battery remaining.

## wofi

Fadein wofi tab at the bottom of the active screen (see screenshot).

## mako

Same styling as the wofi bottom tab, but in the top of the screen.
